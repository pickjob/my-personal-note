- Node
    ```java
    static final class Node {
        static final Node SHARED = new Node();
        static final Node EXCLUSIVE = null;
        static final int CANCELLED =  1;
        static final int SIGNAL    = -1;
        static final int CONDITION = -2;
        static final int PROPAGATE = -3;
        /**
         * Status field, taking on only the values:
         *   SIGNAL:     The successor of this node is (or will soon be)
         *               blocked (via park), so the current node must
         *               unpark its successor when it releases or
         *               cancels. To avoid races, acquire methods must
         *               first indicate they need a signal,
         *               then retry the atomic acquire, and then,
         *               on failure, block.
         *   CANCELLED:  This node is cancelled due to timeout or interrupt.
         *               Nodes never leave this state. In particular,
         *               a thread with cancelled node never again blocks.
         *   CONDITION:  This node is currently on a condition queue.
         *               It will not be used as a sync queue node
         *               until transferred, at which time the status
         *               will be set to 0. (Use of this value here has
         *               nothing to do with the other uses of the
         *               field, but simplifies mechanics.)
         *   PROPAGATE:  A releaseShared should be propagated to other
         *               nodes. This is set (for head node only) in
         *               doReleaseShared to ensure propagation
         *               continues, even if other operations have
         *               since intervened.
         *   0:          None of the above

- 同步器内部结构
    ```java
    // 用state来实现同步器
    private transient volatile Node head;
    private transient volatile Node tail;
    private volatile int state;
    ```
- 同步器state状态方法
    - getState
    - setState(int)
    - compareAndSetState(int)
- 同步器可重写方法
    ```java
    /* 排他模式 */
    // return true if successful. Upon success, this object has been acquired.
    tryAcquire(int)
    // return true if this object is now in a fully released state, so that any waiting threads may attempt to acquire.
    tryRelease(int)
    /* 共享模式 */
    // return <0 failure; 
    //        =0 success and no subsequent shared-mode acquire can succeed;
    //        >0 success and subsequent shared-mode acquires might also succeed, 
    //          in which case a subsequent waiting thread must check availability.
    tryAcquireShared(int)
    // return true if this release of shared mode may permit a  waiting acquire (shared or exclusive) to succeed.
    tryReleaseShared(int)
    // Returns true if synchronization is held exclusively with respect to the current (calling) thread.
    isHeldExclusively()
    ```
- 实际使用的public final模板方法
    ```java
    /* 排他模式 */
    public final void acquire(int arg);
    public final void acquireInterruptibly(int arg);
    public final boolean tryAcquireNanos(int arg, long nanosTimeout);
    public final boolean release(int arg);
    /* 共享模式 */
    public final void acquireShared(int arg);
    public final void acquireSharedInterruptibly(int arg);
    public final boolean tryAcquireSharedNanos(int arg, long nanosTimeout);
    public final boolean releaseShared(int arg);
    ```
