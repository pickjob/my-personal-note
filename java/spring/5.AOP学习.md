# AOP学习
- Concepts
  - Aspect: A modularization of a concern that cuts across multiple classes
  - Join point: A point during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception
  - Advice: Action taken by an aspect at a particular join point
  - Pointcut: A predicate that matches join points
  - Introduction: Declaring additional methods or fields on behalf of a type
  - Target object: An object being advised by one or more aspects
  - AOP proxy: An object created by the AOP framework in order to implement the aspect contracts (advise method executions and so on)
  - Weaving: linking aspects with other application types or objects to create an advised object
- Spring AOP Advice
  - Before advice
  - After returning advice
  - After throwing advice
  - After (finally) advice
  - Around advice
- Pointcut
  - execution: For matching method execution join points. This is the primary pointcut designator to use when working with Spring AOP
  - within / @within: Limits matching to join points within certain types (the execution of a method declared within a matching type when using Spring AOP)
  - this: Limits matching to join points (the execution of methods when using Spring AOP) where the bean reference (Spring AOP proxy) is an instance of the given type
  - targe / @targett: Limits matching to join points (the execution of methods when using Spring AOP) where the target object (application object being proxied) is an instance of the given type
  - args / @args: Limits matching to join points (the execution of methods when using Spring AOP) where the arguments are instances of the given types
  - @annotation: Limits matching to join points where the subject of the join point (the method being executed in Spring AOP) has the given annotation
  - format
    ```
